"Benchmarking Test Systems for Harmonics Modeling and Simulation against Open Source and Commercial Tools", present on PES GM 2024.
Authors: Celso Rocha, Andres Ovalle, Robert Arritt, Roger Dugan and Krishnat Patil

This folder constains two files to reproduce OpenDSS results for the benchmarking exercise. The original IEEE 14 Buses results are available at IEEE Harmonics Modeling and Simulation Task Force website (https://sagroups.ieee.org/harmonicswg/harmonics-modeling-and-simulation-task-force/) - see cases "CASE1CS" and "CASE1TB". The results for the vTHD and cTHD have been copied and placed at "Benchmark Results".

+ Run THD.py: Python script to reproduce results for vTHD and cTHD results.
+ Run_FrequencyScans.dss: DSS script to reproduce frequency scan results.

Both files contain extra instructions.
