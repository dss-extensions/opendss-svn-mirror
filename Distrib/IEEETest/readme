! These commands run all of the IEEE test feeders.
! For documentation of the test feeders, check the following URL:
!   http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/pes/dsacom/testfeeders.html

! All input files have a "dss" or "dat" extension
! The scripts will create many output files with "txt" extensions,
!   which may be deleted safely.  No input file has a "txt" extension.

! Note: cut and paste the following commands into an OpenDSS script
!   window for execution. Or, you can load this whole file into OpenDSS
!   to run all of the cases at once.

! You may need to change the following command to match your installation:

cd c:\opendss\ieeetest
