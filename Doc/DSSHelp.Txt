AlignFile	Alignfile [file=]filename.  Aligns DSS script files in columns for easier reading.
Allocateloads	Estimates the allocation factors for loads that are defined using the XFKVA property. Requires that energymeter objects be defined with the PEAKCURRENT property set. Loads that are not in the zone of an energymeter cannot be allocated.
BuildY	Forces rebuild of Y matrix upon next Solve command regardless of need. The usual reason for doing this would be to reset the matrix for another load level when using LoadModel=PowerFlow (the default) when the system is difficult to solve when the load is far from its base value.  Works by invalidating the Y primitive matrices for all the Power Conversion elements.

Help	Gives this display.
Init	This command forces reinitialization of the solution for the next Solve command. To minimize iterations, most solutions start with the previous solution unless there has been a circuit change.  However, if the previous solution is bad, it may be necessary to re-initialize.

Similar to "Compile", but leaves current directory where it was when Redirect command is invoked.Can temporarily change to subdirectories if nested Redirect commands require.ex:  redirect filename
Reduce	{All | MeterName}  Default is "All".  Reduce the circuit according to reduction options. See "Set ReduceOptions" and "Set Keeplist" options.Energymeter objects actually perform the reduction.  "All" causes all meters to reduce their zones.

Control actions are executed when the time for the pending action is reached or surpassed.Controls may reset and may choose not to act when it comes their time. Use TIME mode when modeling a control externally to the DSS and a solution mode such as DAILY or DUTYCYCLE that advances time, or set the time (hour and sec) explicitly from the external program.

trapezoidal	{YES/TRUE | NO/FALSE}  Default is "No". Specifies whether to use trapezoidal integration for accumulating energy meter registers. Applies to EnergyMeter and Generator objects.  Default method simply multiplies the present value of the registers times the width of the interval. Trapezoidal is more accurate when there are sharp changes in a load shape or unequal intervals. Trapezoidal is automatically used for some load-duration curve simulations where the interval size varies considerably. Keep in mind that for Trapezoidal, you have to solve one more point than the number of intervals. That is, to do a Daily simulation on a 24-hr load shape, you would set Number=25 to force a solution at the first point again to establish the last (24th) interval.

Enter an array of the legal voltage bases, for example:set voltagebases=".208, .480, 12.47, 24.9, 34.5, 115.0, 230.0" When the CalcVoltageBases command is issued, a snapshot solution is performed with no load injections and the bus base voltage is set to the nearest legal voltage base. The defaults are as shown in the example above.
year	Sets the Year (integer number) to be used for the solution. for certain solution types, this determines the growth multiplier.
zonelock	{YES/TRUE | NO/FALSE}  Default is No. if No, then meter zones are recomputed each time there is a change in the circuit. If Yes, then meter zones are not recomputed unless they have not yet been computed. Meter zones are normally recomputed on Solve command following a circuit change.

MVAsc1	MVA Short Circuit, 1-phase fault. Default = 2100. The "single-phase impedance", Zs, is determined by squaring the base kV and dividing by this value. Then Z0 is determined by Z0 = 3Zs - 2Z1.  For 1-phase sources, Zs is used directly. Use X0R0 to define X/R ratio for 1-phase source.
MVAsc3	MVA Short circuit, 3-phase fault. Default = 2000. Z1 is determined by squaring the base kv and dividing by this value. For single-phase source, this value is not used.
phases	Number of phases.  Defaults to 3.
pu	Per unit of the base voltage that the source is actually operating at."pu=1.05"
R0	Alternate method of defining the source impedance. Zero-sequence resistance, ohms.  Default is 1.9.
R1	Alternate method of defining the source impedance. Positive-sequence resistance, ohms.  Default is 1.65.
ScanType	{pos*| zero | none} Maintain specified sequence for harmonic solution. Default is positive sequence. Otherwise, angle between phases rotates with harmonic.
spectrum	Name of harmonic spectrum for this source.  Default is "defaultvsource", which is defined when the DSS starts.
X0	Alternate method of defining the source impedance. Zero-sequence reactance, ohms.  Default is 5.7.
x0r0	Zero-sequence X/R ratio.Default = 3.
X1	Alternate method of defining the source impedance. Positive-sequence reactance, ohms.  Default is 6.6.
x1r1	Positive-sequence  X/R ratio. Default = 4.
